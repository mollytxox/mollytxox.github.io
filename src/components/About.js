            <p className="about-me-text">Kia Ora, My name is Molly Thompson and I am a Junior Web Developer.<br></br> I have created and collaborated on a variety of websites, some of which you can see right here on my portfolio.<br></br> I am an aspiring web designer looking to start my career in the industry. I have a huge passion for anything to do with web and UX design. I am constantly trying to up skill my existing knowledge and keep up to date with what is happening in the industry. One way I do this is by building functional apps, such as the MERN app I built.<br></br> Over the past few months I had the opportunity to gain professional experience working with a Wellington web design company. The project was created using Drupal 9 and we worked in an Agile environment. This experience gave me a taste of what the industry is like and I loved it. I gained professional team working skills, learned my way around another CMS, picked up on key design skills from trained profesionals and learnt how to communicate with clients. I am now ready to find a full time role in web developmet or UX design.<br></br> When I am not coding you can find me out walking in nature, or in the kitchen baking!<br></br> Thank you for visiting my portfolio.</p>
